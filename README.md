# Realista

Realista is a web application exclusively for individuals and without traditional real estate portals ads. Realistic prices and market transparency are the main features of our site. 

Users can publish and search for properties, contact directly with the owner through our chat, without intermediaries. Browse properties by location, view them on the map and dive into their details with photos and detailed descriptions.
